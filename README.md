How to push project in Github:
1. Initialize a Git repository in your local project folder:
Open a terminal window and navigate to your local project folder using the cd command. Then, run the command "git init" to initialize a Git repository in that directory.

2. Add all your project files to the staging area:
Use the command "git add ." (including the dot) to add all files in your project to the Git staging area. This tells Git which files you want to include in your next commit.

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
Run the command "git commit -m "Initial commit"" (replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful message describing your changes). This creates a snapshot of the current state of your project with your message attached.

4. Add the remote repository URL:
"git remote add origin https://github.com/xandrs/Manuscript_online_bookstore.git"

5. Push your commits to the remote repository:
Finally, use the command "git push origin master" to push your local commits (including the initial one) to the "master" branch of the remote repository on GitHub.
